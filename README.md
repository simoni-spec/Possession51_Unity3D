# Characters

GhostBoi – GhostBoi was created as a military weapon, meant to give Mother Rassia an edge over her competitors. In the event of a massive riot at the facility where GhostBoi was being held, he escaped the confines of the machine meant to contain him. In his regular or exposed form (detailed below) GhostBoi cannot interact with any physical objects, which results in him not being able to jump or crouch or use keypads and the like. 


# Story

It is 21st September, 2019. Moments ago, GhostBoi gained consciousness as the containment cell used up the last of it’s backup power. As he looks around GhostBoi finds that most of the scientists that were supposed to be around him have escaped after the alarm sounded. Guards have been dispatched to various parts of the facility in order to try and stop him from escaping, as the management knows that there was no other possible outcome after most of the facility’s mainframe and power generators were nearly destroyed in the massive riots a day prior. 
There are also reports of tons of vials of DNX-8 scattered through the facility, another outcome of the riots. It is of utmost importance that Experiment 70421 doesn’t come into contact with the toxic substance as it’s effects on the subject are still majorly unrecorded. 
In order to give the guards a fighting chance, protocol Obsidian has been green lighted and certain areas of the facility outfitted with IFB tech in their light fixtures have been activated, along with all cameras (some of them outfitted with IFB and other with IFB+ tech) now capable of either detecting or triggering subject’s vulnerable state. All guards are issued handheld flashlights, also equipped with IFB+ technology. 

# Game Mechanics

Possession – You can take control of any guard as long as his/her back is turned towards you and you have “stamina” greater than zero and the time you can stay in possessed form is dictated by the amount of stamina you currently have. Stamina decays while possessing someone, an arbitrary number of stamina points per second. Decay rate is constant for all living beings. You can recharge your stamina by collecting vials of DNX scattered throughout the facility. 
When un-possessing someone, you leave their skeleton behind, which is viable to detection by guards and cameras (details in respective sections below). You may also leave a body behind at will as it suits your interests, and thus you aren’t constrained by the possession timer. 

Guards – Each guard has a well-defined patrol route and a cone of visibility, dictated by the range of their flashlights. You can only be detected by coming into direct contact with the light emitted by the flashlight. While possessing a guard, you are able to jump, crouch and interact with keypads to open doors, which is one of the reasons why you must possess guards at least once to clear a level. 

Static Lights – Static lights are the most basic form of obstacle you will encounter in the game and the lights in the facility are fitted with aforementioned IFB technology that transmits waves at a certain frequency that reveal your true form. However, you are only exposed, not detected. Detection at this stage can happen in the form of a guard stumbling across you or a camera spotting you. 

Cameras
a)	Regular – These function pretty similar to static lights , the only difference being that all cameras have a variable amount of ground they cover and have a unique swerving pattern. All cameras have a blind spot which can be exploited to get past them easily.

b)	Special – These function similar to a guard’s flashlight, meaning they’re equipped with IFB+ technology and can instantly detect you and alert the entire facility, resulting in an instant game over state as soon as you come within the field of view of the camera. 

# Win/Lose
Win Condition – By getting to the end of a level and interacting with the keypad beside the door. 
Lose Condition – Getting detected by a guard, special camera or a combination of a static light and camera or a static light and a guard.
